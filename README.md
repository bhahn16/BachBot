Note: This code was written during high school before we were taught professional coding practices, and does not reflect my current style of software design. In addition, Joe McAllister was the primary contributor to this project, and my role was to assist him in certain areas of development.

To run the console version of the project (SWING Version not uploaded to Github):
  1. Download runnableBachbot.jar
  2. Confirm that a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is installed on your system
  3. Double click the JAR and in a few seconds the program will write an entirely unique song
